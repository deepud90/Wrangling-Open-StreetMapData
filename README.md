# Wrangling-Open-StreetMapData

This project is an attempt at performing some data wrangling tasks on an openstreetmap (osm) file using python and SQL. In this work, some major errors present in the osm (xml) file are audited and cleaned programmatically using python, following which the data is written into a .csv file. The .csv file is then eventually loaded into an database following which some further exploration is done using SQL. The osm file represents the geographical area around Whitefield, located within the city of Bangalore in India. The map is of relatively small size (~ 80 MB), yet some major data cleaning tasks have been performed on the same. 

A detailed description of the project can be found in the "Project_report". All the code files that were made as part of this project can be found in the folder "Code", and the file "Code_Documentation" contains descriptions of the python code written for this work.
