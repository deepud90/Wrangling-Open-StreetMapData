# Wrangling-Open-StreetMapData

This project is an attempt at performing some data wrangling tasks on an openstreetmap (osm) file using python and SQL. Openstreetmap (https://www.openstreetmap.org/about), is a collaborative project built and maintained by a community of mappers with an objective to create free editable maps of the world. Openstreetmap allows download of map data of any region of our interest in the form of an xml file. The osm file used in this work represents the geographical area around Whitefield, located within the city of Bangalore in India. The map file is of relatively small size (~ 80 MB), yet some major data cleaning tasks have been performed on the same.  In this work, some major errors present in the osm (xml) file are audited and cleaned programmatically using python, following which the data is written into a .csv file. The .csv file is then eventually loaded into an database after which some further exploration is done using SQL. 

A detailed description of the project can be found in the "Project_report_copy.pdf". All the code files that were made as part of this project can be found in the folder "Code", and the file "Code_Documentation.pdf" contains descriptions of the python code written for this work. The link to the map file used in this project is found below.
